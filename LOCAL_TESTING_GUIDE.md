# üß™ Local Testing Guide (No Vercel CLI Required!)

Since you're on a company laptop and can't install Vercel CLI, I've added a **development fallback mode** that lets you test the app by simply opening the HTML file in your browser.

## ‚úÖ Easy Local Testing (2 Steps!)

### Step 1: Open the File

Simply open `index.html` in your browser:

**Option A: Double-click the file**
- Navigate to your project folder
- Double-click `index.html`
- It will open in your default browser

**Option B: Drag and drop**
- Drag `index.html` into your browser window

**Option C: From terminal**
```bash
cd "/Users/nicolastecher/Downloads/untitled folder 3"
open index.html
```

### Step 2: Test It!

1. **Check Spotify Status**: You should see ‚úÖ "Connected to Spotify API"
2. **Upload a test Excel file** (with tracks in column A, artists in column B)
3. **Click "Retrieve ISRCs"**
4. **Check the results** table
5. **Test the export checkbox** for release dates
6. **Download the Excel** file

That's it! No installation required! üéâ

## üîí Security Note

### Development Mode (Local Testing)
When you open the file directly, the app runs in **development mode**:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Uses client-side authentication (credentials visible in browser console)
- ‚úÖ Perfect for testing and development
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Not secure** - only use for local testing!

### Production Mode (Deployed on Vercel)
When deployed on Vercel, the app automatically uses:
- ‚úÖ Secure serverless function (`/api/spotify-token`)
- ‚úÖ Credentials hidden in environment variables
- ‚úÖ No exposure in browser
- ‚úÖ **Fully secure** for production use!

The app automatically detects which mode to use, so you don't have to do anything!

## üêõ Troubleshooting Local Testing

### "Failed to connect to Spotify API"

**Check browser console:**
1. Right-click ‚Üí Inspect ‚Üí Console tab
2. Look for error messages
3. If you see CORS errors, that's normal - the fallback should still work

**Solution:** Refresh the page (Cmd+R or Ctrl+R)

### Results not showing

**Possible causes:**
- Excel file doesn't have the correct format (column A should have track titles)
- First row should be headers
- No valid data in the file

**Solution:** Check your Excel file structure

### App looks broken

**Browser cache issue:**
1. Hard refresh: **Cmd+Shift+R** (Mac) or **Ctrl+Shift+F5** (Windows)
2. Or clear browser cache

### Export not working

**Browser popup blocker:**
- Some browsers block downloads
- Check for popup blocker notification
- Allow downloads from `file://` protocol

## üìä Test Excel File Format

Your test Excel file should look like this:

| Column A (Title) | Column B (Artist) | Column C (Empty) |
|-----------------|------------------|------------------|
| Track Title     | Artist Name      |                  |
| Bohemian Rhapsody | Queen          |                  |
| Billie Jean     | Michael Jackson  |                  |
| Shape of You    | Ed Sheeran       |                  |

- **Row 1**: Headers
- **Column A**: Track titles (required)
- **Column B**: Artists (optional but recommended)
- **Column C**: Will be filled with ISRCs

## üöÄ When Ready to Deploy

Once you've tested locally and everything works:

1. **Deploy to Vercel** (see `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`)
2. The app will **automatically switch** to secure mode
3. No code changes needed!

The development fallback is ignored in production - Vercel will use the secure serverless function instead.

## üí° Tips

1. **Use a small test file first** (5-10 tracks) to test quickly
2. **Check browser console** if something doesn't work
3. **Test both with and without artist names** to see uncertain matches
4. **Try the search feature** to filter results
5. **Test export with checkbox both on and off**

## ‚ùì Need Help?

If you run into issues:
1. Check the browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console)
2. Review the troubleshooting section above
3. Make sure your Excel file is formatted correctly
4. Try a different browser (Chrome usually works best)

Happy testing! üéµ
